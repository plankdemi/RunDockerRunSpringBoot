This is the *Run Docker Run (Spring Boot)* project I made myself.


<p>Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a container environment. Container images are lightweight units that contain everything needed to run an application. You can easily share your application with container images; everyone you share it with gets the same container image that works similarly. Container images become containers in the run time. In this project, you will learn how to create and run a container with a web application.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/507?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/507</a>
